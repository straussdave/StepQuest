  chooseText: Select the survey scanner. If the signal source is still active, we
    need a map of the area and a hazard profile before moving closer.
  completedText: "Scanner recovered. Terrain and radiation scans are within tolerances.
    More importantly: there\u2019s a structured site nearby - likely a buried relay
    station. It\u2019s running on emergency power."
  nextDayText: Pilot, consistency beats intensity. One solid walk today is enough
    to keep momentum.
