  chooseText: Select the authorization beacon. If that relay station is still alive,
    it may require a mission signature to release its stored data - or to shut itself
    down safely.
  completedText: "Beacon recovered. I can now authenticate locally. The station wasn\u2019t
    calling for rescue - it was uploading a warning. It detected instability in this
    region and flagged it as a no-fly corridor."
  nextDayText: "Mission tip: start the walk, and motivation shows up on the way.
    Let\u2019s go."
