  abstract  = {Exergaming is the use of video games in an exercise activity. In this paper we consider game design for successful exergames. To do this, we review the history of exergaming and the current state of research in this field. We find that there exists some research aimed at evaluating the physical and health characteristics of exergames, but research on how to design exercise games is still in the early stages. From an analysis of this information, and drawing on established principles from sports science for the prescription of exercise programs, we then attempt to identify success factors to guide designers of exergaming systems.},
